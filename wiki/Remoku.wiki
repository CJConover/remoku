Remoku - A Web App for remote control of Roku Players

= What it does=

Control a Roku Streaming Media Player over a local area network.

Supports all physical buttons found on the newer Roku remotes (Back, Home, Up, Down, Left, Right, OK, Instant Replay, Info, Rev, Play/Pause, Fwd).

Supports direct text entry.

Works on recent versions of most major browsers: Chrome, Firefox 3.6.12, Safari 5.0.2, Mobile Safari/iOS devices(specfically tested iPhone4/ iOS 4.1), and Internet Explorer 8.0.7600(although it's ugly). Opera and Android devices are untested but expected to work (feedback welcome).
Supports the application cache feature of html5. This means that browsers that support application cache will store the whole web app locally and if my site is unavailable, your remote will still work!
= What it doesn't =
No auto-detect Rokus. I'm working on a primitive detection routine, but Javascript is limited in this area.
No support for multiple Rokus. This will be available in the future.
No direct launching of apps. The apps list isn't currently directly retrievable via Javascript. A workaround may be possible.
No advertising.

Requirements: Modern browser with Javascript and cookies turned on.
Instructions: Browse to http://remoku.tv and simply provide the local ip address`*` of a Roku on startup(or afterwards on the Config screen) and click "Remote".
